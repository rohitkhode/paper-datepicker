{"name":"Paper-datepicker","tagline":"A date picker web component with Polymer 1.2","body":"# paper-datepicker\r\nA material design date picker component with Polymer 1.2\r\n\r\nWhy yet another polymer paper date-picker? \r\n\r\nI had my tryst with [this one by David Mulder](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-date-picker) and [this one by bendavis78](https://github.com/bendavis78/paper-date-picker)\r\n\r\nHowever I encountered certain issues and decided to comeup with a solution combining best features from both above components.\r\n\r\n[David Mulder's Date Picker](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-date-picker)\r\nNot supported on Polymer 1.0.\r\nIt provides an infinite scroll. However, I wanted the year-picker to be more like Windows calendar (click on Month-Year header to see all months and then click on year header again to see all years in current decade).\r\n\r\n[bendavis78's Date Picker](https://github.com/bendavis78/paper-date-picker)\r\nYear selector is a scroll. No month selector. As I mentioned, I wanted more like windows calendar behavior.\r\nNo support for start-of-week and disabled-days (weekly off).\r\nLocale support is limited to formatted date display. I needed even the dates/years to be localized.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n===\r\nSupported in Polymer 1.2+,\r\ncomplete locale support along with start-of-week and disabled-days.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n===\r\n \r\n[David Mulder](https://github.com/David-Mulder/paper-date-picker) and [bendavis78](https://github.com/bendavis78/paper-date-picker) for their respective date picker components.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
